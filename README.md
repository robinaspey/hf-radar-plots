# hf-radar-plots
This repository contains matlab files and sample HF Radar data for processing CODAR Seasonde data to radial and totals plots. These files are stored in .tuv, .suv, .ruv on the Central site (PORTUS) server but examples are included as well as the profile for the Red Sea coast near KAUST. This archive also allows for plotting a coastline map with radials (Bragg doppler sea-echo backscatter) and totals os scm (Surface Current Maps).
