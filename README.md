# hf-radar-plots
This repository is for matlab files for processing CODAR Seasonde data to radial and totals plots. These files are normally 
stored in .tuv, .suv files on the server but examples are included as well as the profile for the Red Sea coast near KAUST.  
This archive also allows for plotting a coastline map with radials (Bragg backscatter) and totals (Surface Current Maps).

Revisions:
